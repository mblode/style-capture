 * The house card (Rule 12), replacing the static `public/opengraph-image.png`.
 *
 * Converting the PNG to a generated route is also the Rule 11 fix. A static
 * metadata image in `app/` already carries `basePath`, so pointing
 * `metadataBase` at the zone while that PNG is still there produces
 * `/style-capture/style-capture/opengraph-image.png`. A generated route is not
 * prefixed, so this form is the one that cannot double.
 *
 * The matching `twitter-image.png` is gone rather than converted: Next reuses
 * this route for `twitter:image`, and the old pair were the same file twice.
